- 👋 Hi, I’m @CeceAS (aka Cynthia Sanclemente Gwendo) I'm a Javascript developer, learning full stack web development! My ultimate goal is to be an iOS/Android app developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything Javascript - sometimes I quite literally dream in JS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning back end development (NoSQL, Node.js).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that make life even the slightest bit easier - I have a lot of ideas! 
- 📫 How to reach me: just send me an email! cecesanclemente@gmail.com
